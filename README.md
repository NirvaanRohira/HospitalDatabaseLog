# My Personal Project - Out Patient Directory

## Nirvaan Rohira

Questions needed to be answered
- What will the application do?
- Who will use it?
- Why is this project of interest to you?

This is going to be a OUT Patient Directory with Bill application
This means that anyone who uses it will be able to:-
- Fill in Patient details such as Name, Age, Condition, Care received, Days Stayed, Bill Due
- Search For a Patient using the Search option using LastName, FirstName
- Be able to see a list of treatment received along with cost per night of stay and special treatment costs of a
- Patient with the search function

Primarily this would be for people working in medical clinics and hospitals where there are services of care used along
with place of stay. However, once this project would be complete it can even potentially be edited to be able to work
with other services such as hotels and motels in order to calculate the amount a person should be charged based on
their specific criteria.

This Project is of Interest to me as Ive always wanted to understand how databases work and how they can be used to
search and believe that designing one will help me gain a better understanding of them.
